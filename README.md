## How does it work?
Things doesn't have an API, but it provides a way to add tasks via email. This project makes use of this service by emailing to your _Mail to Things_ address every time you submit the form using Netlify Functions.

## Usage
Once you've deployed the project you should be able to access it on your Android phone and click the `Add Things to home screen` button to install it as an app. You can also use it as a regular website on any platform.
